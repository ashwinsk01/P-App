# P-App
Image Geo-Location finder without metadata.

This project aims to explore the limits of Computer Vision by calculating the nearest probable coordinates of any given image. This is achieved by taking a large dataset of images and running it through an image classifier until it starts to give reasonably accurate results. This can help photographers and the general public alike to find the location of a certain place with a high degree of accuracy.

## Roadmap

```
- [x] Alpha test with 13 locations across Europe 
- [ ] Increase training batch size
- [ ] Optimize and improve image classifier
- [ ] Visually mapping the coordinates
- [ ] Creating a Web App/Mobile App

```
